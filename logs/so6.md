# Session 6 (02/5/26) - [Functions & Interfaces] 
 
## What I learned today 
[In today's session, I learned a lot about different types of functions such as recursive functions and what happens when we have local and not local variabels that are defined. Additionally, I got to develop some functions and see the way that the overall structure and syntax flowed. Not only that, I got a deeper dive into drawing shapes in Python and the details that accompanied it such as spaces and for loops.] 
 
## Code/work I'm proud of (optional) 
[N/A] 
 
## Challenges I faced 
[One challenge I faced was trying to understand the process of drawing the shapes in Python which I found very difficult. I think the concept was a bit confusing in terms of combining for loops and the n-1, n+1 spaces and recognizing patterns in order to build code that'd match the shapes.]
 
## AI usage (if any) 
[N/A] 
 
## Questions for next time 
[Can you spend more time reviewing the shape building code again?]
