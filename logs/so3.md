# Session 3 (01/27/26) - [Programming as a Way of Thinking and Variables & Statements] 
 
## What I learned today 
[In today's session, after reading Chapter's 1 and 2, I got a very detailed introduction to the structure and syntax behind the way that Python code operates. For example, I particularly zoomed in on functions and what it means to define and call one and the difference between return and print in functions. I noticed that much of the scaffolding that Python requires is very like everyday human language and some of the aspects were a bit similar to RStudio. For example, when I learned about modules in Chapter 2, it reminded me of packages in RStudio as it's a pre-prepared set of code that can be repeatedly used. I also learned about the different kinds of errors that can exist i.e. runtime, semantic, and syntax error which is quite different from RStudio as oftentimes in R, if your code doesn't work, it immediately returns an error. It was interesting to see that semantic erorrs occur where your code still runs, but it doesn't turn out the way you wanted it to.] 
 
## Code/work I'm proud of (optional) 
[N/A] 
 
## Challenges I faced 
[One challenge I faced was understanding something from the reading in Chapter 2 when they talked about some functions taking additional arguments. For example, one of the cases that they used in the reading was someting like int('101',2) but I wasn't sure what the base part meant and how that connected to the '101'.]
 
## AI usage (if any) 
[I used DeepSeek to help verify if my file structure and setup for the zip file Jupyter Notebooks was correct.] 
 
## Questions for next time 
[What's the difference between VSCode and Jupyter Notebook?]
