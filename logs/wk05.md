# Week 5
 
## What I learned this week  
[In this week's session, I learned about the difference between while and for loops, when to use print and return, and the varied outputs that come out as a result. I also got a chance to experiment with the Python keywords of break and continue as these can be great tools to gracefully exit a function or proceed if necessary. Lastly, I learned about the impact that return and print has on if/else conditionals i.e. if there are two if blocks, one after the other, and if there's a print that's underneath, it'll print out the result, whereas if you have return above a print, it'll immediately end the function.]

## Challenges I faced 
[One challenge I faced was understanding the intersectionality of while, for, and if/elseloops and how the impact of return/print has on the different outputs you can get. It can also have a connection to Boolean operators and whether something is true or false, especially if it's nested in a loop or conditional.]

## Questions for next time 
[What is  i += 1 again in a while loop?]
