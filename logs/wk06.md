# Week 6
 
## What I learned this week  
[In this week's session, I learned more about the difference between while loops, for loops, and the intersection that it has with if, else, and elif. I also got more experience with break and continue and what to do when you have code outside of loops. Furthermore, we covered strings and the syntax when you have lists or want to slice/dice/index.] 
 
## Code/work I'm proud of (optional) 
[N/A] 
 
## Challenges I faced 
[One challenge I faced was understanding what to do when you have code inside and outside the loop because the outcomes are quiet different so it was a bit challenging to figure out the syntax and what should come out in a specific context.]
