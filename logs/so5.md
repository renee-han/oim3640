# Session 5 (02/3/26) - [Functions] 
 
## What I learned today 
[In today's session, I learned a lot about functions, what they are, and how they are structurally built. I also got a chance to experiment a bit with recursive functions and how those flow in relation to a continuous flow of code that doesn't stop unless you manually pause it. Furthermore, I got a small taste of if else loops and how those could be baked into functions too.] 
 
## Code/work I'm proud of (optional) 
[I ended up completing the exercises for both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 and found it very helpful in being able to apply what I've learned both in class and from the readings into practice. I'm particularly proud of Exercise #4 from Ch. 1 and Part 2 and Part 3 from Ch.2. These changes can be viewed in my committs/pushes in GitHub.] 
 
## Challenges I faced 
[One challenge I faced was with the last part of the exercise for Chapter 2 as I was a bit confused with the math.exp part and trying to decipher code that equated to the instruction of taking the value of x as an argument and computing e^x. I also had a bit of difficulty when we did recursive functions and what large purpose they serve, especially when we connected it with Booelean.]
 
## AI usage (if any)

## Questions for next time 
[Can you review the f string syntax in functions again?]
