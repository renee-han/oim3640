# Week 4 
 
## What I learned this week  
[In this week's session, I learned about the jupyturtle module in Python and got to see how functions could be written in order to build repetitive shapes such as overlaid squares that can loop over and over again. I also learned that speed can play a role in drawing the shape in terms of how fast the 'turtle' can draw the shape and the size of the drawn shapes as well. Additionally, in Session 8, I learned about if, else, elif, conditionals, and really understanding the logic steps in terms of if something does or does not meet a condition, then what are your next steps. Finally, I learned about abstraction and decomposition and how this applies to writing better programs as a coder.] 
 
## Code/work I'm proud of (optional) 
[N/A] 
 
## Challenges I faced 
[One challenge I faced was understanding the way that the turtle package workced and its relation to our prior knowledge of creating functions. Another thing that I found difficult was understanding the incremental development slide and its connection to return values.]
 
## AI usage (if any)

## Questions for next time 
[Can you go over the turtle package and its connection to functions again?]
