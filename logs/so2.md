# Session 2 (01/15/26) - [Version Control & GitHub] 
 
## What I learned today 
[In today's session, I learned about the roles that VSCode, Git, GitHub, PowerShell, and Anaconda will play in our coursework going forward. To clarify, the reason why Git and GitHub are so necessary for our daily work in Python is to ensure version control maintenance which means that instead of having multiple separate folders for every change you make, we can now have one folder with all the changes in one spot. This can be executed with Git as the underlying operating system with GitHub Desktop and GitHub online where the former serves as the GUI and the latter is a place where you can review your changes and collaborate with others. I also learned that you can usee the Command Line Prompt as a commmunication tool to converse with the computer on any tasks you wnat to perform.] 
 
## Code/work I'm proud of (optional) 
[print("Hello world!")] 
 
## Challenges I faced 
[One challenge I faced was a bit of confusion on the intermingled roles of VSCode, Anaconda, PowerShell, Command Line Prompt, and most importantly, the difference between Git and GitHub. They are all crucial tools for this class so there was a bit of difficulty understanding their relations to one another and differences]
 
## AI usage (if any) 
[I used ChatGPT to help me in understanding the roles and functionalities of the previously mentioned platforms and the difference between Git, GitHub Desktop, and Git.com.] 
 
## Questions for next time 
[Can you explain what Git Bash and Power Shell is?]
