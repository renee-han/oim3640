# Session 4 (01/29/26) - [Functions] 
 
## What I learned today 
[In today's session, I learned more about the ins and outs of Python syntax and the different errors that arise such as syntax error, name error, and type error. I also got a chance to clarify some confusion with the connection between PowerShell, VSCode, and Jupyter Notebook. I learned how to run JN files in VSCode and also separately while getting a refresher on version control and Git basics.] 
 
## Code/work I'm proud of (optional) 
[N/A] 
 
## Challenges I faced 
[One challenge I faced was still understanding what PowerShell is and how it relates to Command Line. Another thing that I found difficult was some of the end of chapter exercises in the Jupyter Notebook where I needed to be able to translate my thoughts from paper to code.]
 
## AI usage (if any)
