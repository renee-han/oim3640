## My Project Proposal

## What I'm building: [For my first mini project, I plan to build a mini secret number guessing game where the end user has 6 tries to guess two numbers, x and y, from a range of values from 1 to 12. I plan to incoporate all the material we've covered so far in class such as if/else statements, loops, asking for user input, and functions. In terms of having a clean and elegant finish to this game, the ending should culminate when the user runs out of tries and the code should return something like, "You guessed right!" or or "You ran out of tries, better luck next time or play again."]

## Why I'm building it: [The reason why I'm building this game is because I really want to be able to experiment with a simple BIOS system i.e. using user inputs, processing those inputs, and then being able to return an output. I believe this will help tremendously with decision making and being able to connect concise logic with stable UX features]

## Notable features:[1. Having a range of numbers the user can guess from 2. Asking user for input 3. Loops until the user guesses right and when tries are up, exiting]

## What I don't know yet: [I need to figure out how I'm going to incorporate functions and what will make this game unique. Beyond just guessing and checking to see if the user guess is right, I want to add some sort of flair to it to make the connection between user and program more alive.]
