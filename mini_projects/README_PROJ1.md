## Mini Project #1 Outline + Instructions

## What it is: [A combination of a secret number guessing game and treasure hunt game]

## How to run it: [The entire game is built on the premise of being both a secret number guessing game and treasure hunting game where the player has 10 tries to guess the correct number that's between 1 and 100. The user only has 10 attempts to guess and will be prompted for their input with the line, "Guess a number between 1 and 100." Additionally, the user should refrain from trying to use negative values or values that aren't numbers like characters, as this will immediately be hit with an error. As the user makes their way through their attempts, if they guess correctly on the first try, they will get the 'Tier 1' prize which is the crown. If they guess correctly in 2 tries, they get the 'Tier 2' prize which is a jewel and if they guess in 3 or more tries, they get the 'Tier 3' prize which is a coin. If the user runs out of choices or doesn't want to play anymore, the game ends or loops back/continues on again. Finally, the user is able to keep track of a virtual 'wallet' where it serves as a 'bag' that collects all accumulated prizes.]
